# Roadmap ArduPi

## Current STATUS

0.1
	- Schematic currently being designed.
	- Need schematic review.
	- pcb layout.
	- Need addition review.

## ArduPi-0.1	OPAL design reference.

- RPI-4b footprint.
- Standard IC's on board:
	- pca9685: "unfortunately unobtainium": leaving as module many options available now.
	- ULN2803A
	- ADS1115
	- MPU9650
	- BMP280
- Module footprints:
	- pca9685
	- GPS:NEO-M8Q-01A
	- ExpressLRS:RFM95W-915S2

## ArduPi-0.2a	RP2040

- research can rp2040 do pwm/ads/led/buzzer. If this is indeed viable, enough channels etc.
- kinda cool raspberry pi all the way up and down.

## ArduPi-0.2b	stm32

- F1 is all i can get right now but almost certainly going this route.

## ArduPi-CM4	0.3

- RPI-Compute Module 4 carrier board.

## ArduPi-Cube

- RPI CM4: Cube carrier.

## ArduPi-0.5	sensor update 

- redundant sensors
- optical flow / lidar sensor
- airspeed sensor

## ArduPi-Dock
Docking board(s) for individual vehicles with intergrated ESC / Power Connectors
making ArduPi Pluggable into different vehicles.

## 0.6-alpha

## 0.7-beta

## 0.8-rc

## 0.8-stable
